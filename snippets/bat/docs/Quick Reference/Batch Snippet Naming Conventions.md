## Prefix System

We use a two-letter category prefix followed by a descriptive name:

- `bf`: Batch File operations
- `bs`: Batch String operations
- `bv`: Batch Variable operations
- `bc`: Batch Control structures
- `bn`: Batch Network operations
- `by`: Batch System commands

## Naming Rules

1. All snippet names should be lowercase.
2. Use camelCase for multi-word descriptive names.
3. Keep names short but descriptive.
4. Avoid using special characters or spaces in names.

## Examples

- bfcopy: Batch File Copy
- bslen: Batch String Length
- bvset: Batch Variable Set
- bcif: Batch Control If
- bnping: Batch Network Ping
- bysysinfo: Batch System Information

## Best Practices

1. Be consistent with naming across all categories.
2. Choose names that are easy to remember and type.
3. If adding a new snippet, ensure it follows the established conventions.
4. When in doubt, prioritize clarity over brevity.

## Extending the System

If new categories are needed:

1. Choose a unique two-letter prefix.
2. Update this convention document.
3. Add the new category to the main README.
4. Create a new markdown file for the category.
